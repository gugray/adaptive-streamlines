# Example: library included from NPM

This example shows how to include the library in your project from NPM, via package.json. This needs to have Node.js installed on your system.

To run the example, restore packages (I like to use yarn for that), then run the build script with the --watch argument:

```
yarn install
node build.js --watch
```
