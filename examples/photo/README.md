# Example: photo hatching

This is a cool photo hatching example that converts an image to a flowy line drawing.

To run the example, restore packages (I like to use yarn for that), then run the build script with the --watch argument. You need to have Node.js on your system.

```
yarn install
node build.js --watch
```
